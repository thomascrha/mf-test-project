# Mentally Friendly Notes/Journal

### <ins>Descisions and Planning - 30/07/2019 0830</ins>

On top of the documentation and trello board I've decieded to write a journal for a verbose experience of my thoughts and process's throughout this projects life cycle. 

I recieved the design brief yesterday and have had the luxury of 24 hours to think about how I'm going to approach this project. 

##### Technologies

* Git/Github/Git-Flow - Will utilise the git-flow working off the `develop`branch, once the project is done do a `release`. Use github to display the code and place this as the README.md
* Vue.js/Vue-CLI - Utilise Vue.js as the frontend framework following its design guide and principles, also use Vue-CLI for tooling and project layout
* Trello/Markdown - Use trello as a high level task/feature list, utilise time-estimation within cards. For all other notes and docuumentaton use markdown.
* BootstrapVue - utilise bootstrap-vue for css https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/

##### Descions

* Minimise the use of external liabries - make the code as vinalla Vue.js as possible
* Make the site responsive to widths
* Incorperate some basic testing of the project
* Make it [Zen](https://nicoledominguez.com/assets/public/zen-py.png) - although this isn't a python project I belive these are great points to guide me along the path

My main goal is to complete the two sorting stories provieded in the design brief. To get there I'm going to create some basic stories outlining what I need to do to get to that point. 

I've set up trello with 3 lists; `Todo`: tasks that are in the backlog, `Doing`: currently in progress and `Done`: things that have been completed also will place an actual time spent at this point to identify and discrepencies in my estimates.

> 1 point = 30 minutes

Intial board, I expect this to change as I go down the rabbit hole, but this has the overall tasks, but generally I'll then break down these tasks into smaller stories/features. I'll also link the git commits into each card and where they fit into the dev cycle.
